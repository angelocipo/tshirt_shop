# Project instructions

## Always flag anomalies
Always check the data and the result, and proactively tell the user when something looks strange —
don't silently accept it and don't silently "fix" it either. Report it and ask.

Examples of things to always flag:
- Prices that don't increase with quantity, or a faster delivery that costs less than a slower one
- Duplicate / identical values where a progression is expected
- Missing tiers, formats, papers or delivery options compared to sibling products
- Values that break the established markup rule or pattern
- Inconsistencies between the front-end price table (index.html) and the server-side
  validation table (api/_pricing-data.js), or between displayed / quoted / charged amounts
- Broken or missing links, images, env vars, or pages

Rule: verify before delivering, then state clearly what looks off and let the user decide.

## Always say exactly what to upload to GitHub

The live site runs from GitHub → Vercel. The user uploads files by hand through the GitHub
web interface, so at the end of every turn that changed code, list precisely:

- **Da caricare** — only the files actually modified this turn, with full paths
  (e.g. `api/stripe-webhook.js`, `index.html`). Never "the whole project".
- **Da NON caricare** — anything in the project that must stay off the live site:
  `uploads/` (WordPress backups and screenshots, publicly downloadable once deployed),
  preview/anteprima files, and any temporary diagnostic endpoint.
- **Da cancellare a mano su GitHub** — uploading a folder does NOT delete files that were
  removed from the project. Deletions must be called out separately, file by file.

After the upload, remind the user to wait for **Ready** on Vercel, and note when a change
also needs a manual **Redeploy** (new or edited environment variables only take effect on
deploys created afterwards).
